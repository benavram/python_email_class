# python_email_class
reusable email class for python using smtplib

Found myself frequently writing email solutons as part of apps I was building so I thougth I would write something that I could easily tailor and drop into any project.

built in python2.7 and uses smtplib, but should work fine in python3.  I also dropped in (and commented out) some jinja stuff for templated email.
